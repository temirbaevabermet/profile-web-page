The first page is the main page. There you can see a navigation menu that helps you browse each page faster and more conveniently. A navigation menu is present on every page.
The second page contains information about me. This page mainly consists of texts; I also added gifs to make the web page more unusual and aesthetic.
The third page is a resume, I tried to make it look like the original ones, I used Flexbox here to combine a photo and a small text. Below is just information about my studies, my interests, etc.
The fourth page is about my works, I added photos here and at the bottom of these photos I attached links through which you can see the original version of the works. Here, too, I used Flexbox to evenly distribute the photos.
The fifth page contains my gallery. Flexbox was used here too. It simplified my task several times.
And the very last page is about my contacts, I attached links from my social networks there so that you can conveniently and quickly view or contact me.
I tried to make the web page clear and easy to use. This work helped me consolidate all the past topics.
