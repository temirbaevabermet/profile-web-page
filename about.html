    <h1 class="cinzel">⭒ About me ⭒</h1>
    <img src="images\ATEd.gif" alt="Anime gif" class="img2Style">
    <p class="architects-daughter-regular">♥ As I already said, my name is Bermet, I want to tell you some personal information about myself. Since childhood, I have lived in Kyrgyzstan, namely in the city of Bishkek. I have not yet had the opportunity to visit other countries, but in the future I plan to visit countries such as South Korea, Japan, some states of the USA, Italy etc. 
        I can describe myself as responsible, fair, stubborn, patient, touchy, reserved, and sometimes even an unstable person. Acquaintances often say that I am a very serious person, and I look just as serious, but it isn't like that. Cause with my close people I can be completely different. Like more sociable, kind, generous.♥

    <h1 class="cinzel"style="font-size: 30px;">My Hobbies</h1>
    <p class="architects-daughter-regular" style="border-top: 2px solid #004792;">✮ I have three hobbies. I'll tell about them one by one.<span>Volleyball:</span> I started playing volleyball two years ago, the reason for this was my friend  who was really good at this sport. After watching volleyball competitions, I began to be interested in volleyball. Now this sport is an integral part of my life. <span>Swimming:</span> I started going swimming in the eighth grade. At that time I did not know how to swim, this became the reason to try myself in this sport. I love swimming because it brings me peace and tranquility.✮

    </p>
    <p class="architects-daughter-regular" >✯<span>Drawing:</span> I love drawing people, especially anime characters. As I remember, I have been drawing since childhood, and over time my abilities have improved a lot. The pictures above are my works.✯
